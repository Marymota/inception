Dockerfiles
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains all the commands needed to build a Docker image.

Some important commmands:

    FROM - specifies the base image for the Dockerfile

    RUN - runs a command in the container

    WORKDIR - sets the working directory for the container

    COPY - copies files from the host computer to the container

    CMD - specifies the command that will run when the container starts

    EXPOSE - makes a port available outside the container

    ENV - defines environment variable 



Building an Image from a Dockerfile

- build container
    $ docker build -t <image name> <Dockerfile directory>

- port 4000 on the host computer is mapped to port 80 on the container:
    $ docker run -p 4000:80 <image name>
